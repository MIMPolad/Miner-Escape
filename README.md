Welcome to MinerEscape.. You are a miner who is visiting the Experimental Mine. You have just been cut off from the outside of Missouri S&T's campus after a gigantic cave 
in has occurred. You need to find a way (or blow a way) before your Oxygen runs out. But be careful, there are many ways that someone could become lost in the mine forever,
and never see the light of day again... Good luck, and happy mining!
